## 📊 Usage

### Loading ECG Data

1. Navigate to the "File Upload" tab
2. Upload your ECG data file (CSV, TXT, or NPY format)
3. Alternatively, use the test data generators for quick testing


### Visualizing ECG Data

1. After loading data, the application automatically switches to the visualization tab
2. Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
3. Drag to pan the view
4. Click on an R-peak to select it for detailed analysis


### R-Peak Detection

1. Navigate to the "ECG Visualization" tab
2. Click "Detect All R-Peaks" button
3. Adjust detection parameters in the settings if needed


### Segment Analysis

1. Select an R-peak by clicking on it
2. The application extracts a segment around the selected R-peak
3. Navigate to the "Grid View" tab to see all segments


### Arrhythmia Classification

1. Navigate to the "Model Analysis" tab
2. Select a classification model
3. Click "Classify Segment" to analyze the selected segment
4. View classification results and confidence scores


### Key Components

- **Data Management**: Handles data loading, buffering, and processing
- **Visualization**: Renders ECG signals, R-peaks, and grid views
- **Analysis**: Performs R-peak detection, segment extraction, and classification
- **Model Management**: Handles model loading, selection, and inference


## 🧪 Algorithms

### R-Peak Detection

The application uses an enhanced Pan-Tompkins algorithm with wavelet denoising for R-peak detection:

1. Signal preprocessing (wavelet denoising)
2. High-pass filtering to remove baseline wander
3. Derivative calculation to emphasize QRS complexes
4. Squaring to make all values positive
5. Moving window integration
6. Adaptive thresholding for peak detection


### Segment Extraction

Segments are extracted around detected R-peaks:

1. Calculate segment boundaries based on R-peak position
2. Extract data within boundaries
3. Apply padding if necessary to ensure consistent length
4. Normalize segment data for classification


### Arrhythmia Classification

The application supports classification of ECG segments into five classes:

- **N**: Normal beat
- **S**: Supraventricular premature beat
- **V**: Ventricular premature beat
- **F**: Fusion beat
- **Q**: Unknown beat
